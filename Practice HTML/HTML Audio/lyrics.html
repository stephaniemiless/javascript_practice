        Think I need someone older
        Just a little bit colder
        Takes the weight off your shoulders
        Think I need someone older

        Baby, am I your little secret?
        18, I'm old enough to keep it

        Yeah, I guess my age just don't do the same
        I'm young and that's okay

        Think I need someone older
        Just a little bit colder
        Takes the weight off your shoulders
        Think I need someone older

        Darling, hold me while you wipe my tears
        Falling, you say I'm wise beyond my years

        Yeah, I guess my age just don't do the same
        I'm young and that's okay

        Think I need someone older
        Just a little bit colder
        Takes the weight off your shoulders
        Think I need someone older

        I know I'm younger than your lover
        But I've always wanted a man
        For the summer
        Age is a number
        My dear, I know you'll understand

        Think I need someone older
        Just a little bit colder
        Takes the weight off your shoulders
        Think I need someone older
